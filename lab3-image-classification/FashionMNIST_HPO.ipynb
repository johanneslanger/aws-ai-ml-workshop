    "Welcome to our example introducing Amazon SageMaker! To drive this example, we will show you how to use Amazon SageMaker to learn how to build and deploy a model to recognize the type of apparel from images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in machine learning is to get data to learn from. For our example, we will use the [Fashion MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) dataset which consists of images of apparel, classified from zero to nine representing what kind of apparel they represent.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contains labeled examples ( **`x`**, `y`) where **`x`** is a high dimensional vector and `y` is a numeric label. As the dataset we are using for training contains labels for what the correct answer \"should be\", this example falls under the category of Supervised Learning. Once the model is deployed, we will be predicting which of 10 possible values (0,1,2 .. 9) the image falls under, the type of machine learning we are doing is Supervised Classification. Lastly, since the predictions can be one of 10 values rather than a yes/no type of response, this example demonstrates Supervised Multiclass Classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, we need to set up the environment with a few prerequisite steps, for permissions, configurations, and so on."
